# Machine-Learning-Codes

"EM_Final.py" is the code for Expectation Maximization algorithm. Implemented on data to understand the clustering.

"SIgnal_Detection_Code.m" written to understan detect the transmitted and observed signal 
using hypothesis testing and probabiliity calculation. 
The transmitted and observed signals are generated by random numbers of 0 and 1 which is done by binchan(p0,l1,l0) method.

"Signal_Detection_Hypothesis_Testing.m" is designed on given data. 
By seeing the natuure of the data I need to design the decison rules and then calculate the probaility.
The nature of the data understood by histogram plotting and density plottig 
named as "Visualization_Hist_Hypothesis_Testing.jpg" and "Visualization_Density_Hypothesis_esting.jpg" respectively.
